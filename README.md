## Introduction

Certainly! If you prefer a more straightforward and concise introduction, here's an updated version for the README.md file:

Introduction
Plantsper is a Tkinter-based Python application that allows you to calculate plant densities and spacing effortlessly. 
Whenever you need plant density information, this app provides a user-friendly interface for all your calculations. 
It supports metric and imperial units, allowing you to work with the measurement system you need.

## Features
- Calculate the number of plants per area based on plant spacing.
- Calculate plant spacing required to achieve a specific plant density per area.
- Support for both metric and imperial units.
- Intuitive graphical user interface built with Tkinter.

## Getting Started
To use Plantsper, follow the installation instructions below.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x should be installed on your system.
- Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations. However, if you encounter any issues with Tkinter, you may need to install it separately.

### Installation
1. Download the "Plantsper" repository from GitHub.
2. Extract the files to a directory of your choice.

## How to Use
1. Locate the `PlantsPerM2_v2` file.
2. Double-click on `PlantsPerM2_v2` to launch the application.
3. The Plantsper window will appear, presenting you with three fields:
   - **Row spacing**: Enter the plant spacing (in your preferred unit).
   - **column spacing**: Enter the plant spacing (in your preferred unit).
   - **column spacing**: Enter the desired plant density (plants per area in your preferred unit) and the area size (in square units).
4. With Density and/or one spacing filled in it will find the required plant spacing, with both spacings filled in it will provide the density of plants (in a range of units).

### Supported Units
Plantsper supports the following units for plant spacing and area size:

#### Length Units:
**Metric**: millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), meters (m), kilometers (km)
**Imperial**: inches (in), feet (ft), yards (yd), rods (rod)
#### Density Units:
**Metric**: square centimeters (cm²), square meters (m²), hectares (ha), square kilometers (km²)
**Imperial**: square inches (in²), square feet (ft²), square yards (yd²), square rods (rod²), acres (ac), square miles (mi²)
You can freely switch between these length and density units while using the app, making it versatile for various measurement systems.
